<p class="song">
<br/>To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
<br/>Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
<br/>No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
<br/>The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
<br/>Big iron on his hip
<br/>It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
<br/>He came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
<br/>"He's an outlaw loose and runnin'", came a whisper from each lip
<br/>"And he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip
<br/>In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
<br/>Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
<br/>He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four
<br/>And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more
<br/>One and nineteen more
<br/>Now the stranger started talkin' made it plain to folks around
<br/>Was an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
<br/>He was here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
<br/>And he said it didn't matter that he was after Texas Red
<br/>After Texas Red
<br/>Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red
<br/>But the outlaw didn't worry, men who tried before were dead
<br/>Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip
<br/>Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
<br/>Big iron on his hip
<br/>Now the morning passed so quickly and it was time for them to meet
<br/>It was twenty past eleven when they rode out in the street
<br/>Folks were watchin' from their windows
<br/>Every body held their breath
<br/>They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
<br/>About to meet his death
<br/>There was twenty feet between them
<br/>When they stopped to make their play
<br/>And the swiftness of the Ranger still talked about today
<br/>Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
<br/>And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip
<br/>Big iron on his hip
<br/>It was over in a moment and the crowd all gathered 'round
<br/>There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
<br/>Oh, he might have went on livin' but he made one fatal slip
<br/>When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
<br/>Big iron on his hip
<br/>Big iron, big iron
<br/>Oh he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
<br/>Big iron on his hip
